    <p>The Marghuerita Pizza is not just a simple pizza, it is a cultural heritage. The edge of the pizza is high, puffy, and full of air, while the center is very thin.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheat flour</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to its highest setting (typically 250°C - 275°C) with the grill function on top.</li>
        <li>Stretch the dough by hand on flour. Do not use a rolling pin (or you will kill the air bubbles in the edges). Leave the center thin and the edges thick. </li>
        <li>Place a pan over high heat. Place the stretched dough in the pan without oil. When the base is golden brown (2 minutes), turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>With the dough still in the pan, add the tomato, mozzarella, and oil.</li>
        <li>Place the pan (if the handle is suitable) or transfer the pizza to a baking sheet on the top rack of the oven. In 2 or 3 minutes, when the edge has puffed up and the cheese is bubbling, remove it from the oven. Add the basil as it comes out.</li>
    </ol>
